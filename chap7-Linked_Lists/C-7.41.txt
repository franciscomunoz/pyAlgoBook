Excercise C-5.29 introduced the notion of a natural join of two databases.
Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm for computing the natural join 
of a linked list A of n pairs and a linked list B of m pairs.

Solution:

(x,y) abd (y,z)

After performing the natural join
(x,y,z)


Iterate linked list A and save values in a dictionary where the key is y

Iterate  linked list B and look for y in dictionary previously created. If the
key is there, then create the join in a new linked list
