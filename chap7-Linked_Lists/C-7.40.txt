Describe an efficient method for maintaining a favorits list L, with move-to-
front heuristic, such that elements that have not been accessed in the most
recent n accesses are automatically purged from the list

Solution :


Maintain a global count of the number of accesses in the sequence, and then 
with each element in the list, we will keep track of the time stamp for its 
most recent access. After each operation is performed, we examine the last 
item in the list and if its most recent access is no longer within the most 
recent n operations, that element is deleted. 
(Note that only one element can be purged after a single operation, as it can 
be the only one whoâ€™s most recent access was precisely n + 1 operations ago.)
