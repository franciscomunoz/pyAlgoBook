Repeat the previous process using recursion, Your method should not contain 
any loops. How much space does your method use in addition to the space.

Solution:


def find(self,e,node):
    
    return self._find_recur(e, self.header._next)

def _find_recur(self, e, current):
    if current is self._trailer:
        return None
    else:
        if current.element == e:
            return self.Position(self,current)
        return _find_recur(current._next,e)
