There seems to be redundancy in the repertoire of positional list ADT, as the 
operation L.add_first(e) could be enacted by the alternative 
L.add_before(L.first(),e). Likewise, L.add_last(e) might be performed as 
L.add_after(L.last(),e). Explain why the methods add_first add_last

Solution:


L.add_before(L.first(),e)
L.add_after(L.last(),e)

Each require to function calls. In addition, This methods don't work when the
list is empty.
