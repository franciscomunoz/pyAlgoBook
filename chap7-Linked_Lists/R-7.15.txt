Provide support for a __reversed__method of the PositionalList class that is 
similar to the given __iter__, but that iterates the elements in reversed order

Solution:

def __reversed__(self):
    """Generate a backward iterator of the elements of  the list"""
    cursor = self.last()
    while cursor is not None:
        yield cursor.element()
        cursor = self.before(cursor)
