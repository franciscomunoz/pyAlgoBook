Describe a recursive algorithm that counts the number of nodes in a single Linked
List

Iterative Solution:

def count(L)
    count = 0
    current = L._head
    while current != None:
        current = current._next
        count += 1
    return count

Recursive Solution:

def count(node):

    if node == Node:
        return 0
    else:
    return count(node._next) + 1
