Describe a good algorithm for concatenating two singly linked lists L and M,
given only references to the first node of each list, into a single list L'
that contains all the nodes of L followed by all the nodes of M

Solution:
We assume the lists are using the LinkedQueue abstraction
concatenate(L,M)
    current = L._head       
    while current is not None:
        current = current._next
    current = M._head
    
    M._head = None ? :D
