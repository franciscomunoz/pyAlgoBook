Suppose that we have made kn total accesses to the elements in a list L of n 
elements, for some integer k >= 1. What are the minimum and maximum number of 
elements that have been accessed fewer than k times?

Solution:

The minimum is k
Maximum is n - 1 since we could possibly have accessed one element just kn times
