Implement a function with signature transfer(S, T) that transfers all elements
from stack S onto stack T, so that the element that starts at the top of  is the
first to be inserted onto T, and the element at the bottom of S ends up at the 
bottom of T


S   1       T   4
    2           3
    3           2
    4           1

This is the idea :

transfer(S, T)

    while ( !S.empty() )
        T.push ( S.pop() )
