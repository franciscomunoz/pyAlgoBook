Suppose Alice has picked threee distinc integers and placed then into a Stack S
in random order. Write a short, straight-line piece of pseudo-code (no loops or
recursion) that uses only one comparison and only one variable x, yet that 
results in variable x storing the largest of Alice's three integers with
probability 2/3. Argue why your metho is correct



Solution:

The method for obtaining the largest value with 2/3 of probability is the 
following :

x = S.pop
x = x if x > S.top() else S.top()

The other 1/3 is in the stack
