Suppose you have a deque D containing the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), in 
this order. Suppose further that you have an initially empty queue Q. Give a
code fragment that uses only D and Q (and no other variables) and results in D
storing the elements in the order (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)


Solution :

The idea is to do random Queue/Dequeue operations, then finish with 
the original sequence

D.add_last(D.delete_first()) 
D.add_last(D.delete_first()) 
D.add_last(D.delete_first()) 
Q.enqueue(D.delete_first()) 
Q.enqueue(D.delete_first())
D.add_first(Q.dequeue()) 
D.add_first(Q.dequeue())
D.add first(D.delete_back())
D.add_first(D.delete_back())
D.add first(D.delete_back())
