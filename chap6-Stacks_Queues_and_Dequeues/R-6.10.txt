Consider what happens if the loop in the ArrayQueue._resize method at lines 
53-55 of Code Fragment 6.7 had been implemented as:

for k in range(self._size):
    self._data[k] = old[k] #rather than old[walk]

Give a clear explanation of what could go wrong.

The problem is too obvious !


Imagine the following array representing the queue

                     
index   0 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9
data    5 3 5 9 6 4 2 2 2 2 2
                        ^ ^
                        | | 
                        | front
                        end of queue

If a resize occurs, the internal representation would be destroyed when doing a
simple assignment.

index   0 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ...
data    5 3 5 9 6 4 2 2 2 2 2
        ^
        |
        front
