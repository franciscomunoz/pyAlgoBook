Ha the queue of the previous problem been an instance of ArrayQueue that used
an initial array of capacity 30, and its size never been greater than 30, what 
would be the final value of the _front_instance variable 

Solution

_front variable moves to the right in a circular buffer when the enqueue operation
succeeds. The value for this problem would be 10.
