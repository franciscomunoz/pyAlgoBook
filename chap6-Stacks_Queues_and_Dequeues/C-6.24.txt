Describe how to implement the stack ADT using a single queue as a instance 
variable, and only constant additional local memory within the method bodies.
What is the running time of the push(), pop(), and top() methods for your design?



Solution :

Push  is O(n)
pop and top O(1)

Top aligment 
n = 0
push (val)
    i = 0
    Q.enqueue(val)
    while i != n
    Q.enqueue(Q.dequeue())
    n++    


pop()
    n--
    return Q.dequeue()

top()
    return Q.front()
