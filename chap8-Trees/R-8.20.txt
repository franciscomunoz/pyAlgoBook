Draw a binary tree T that simultaneously satisfies the following:

A preorder traversal of T yields EXAMFUN
An inorder traversal of T yields MAFXUEN

Solution:

By looking at the information, we realize the root is E and the first leaf node
(from left to right) is M. This allows to build the following tree :


                                E
    
                    X                       N
            
            A               U

    M               F
