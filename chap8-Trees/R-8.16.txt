Let T a binary tree with n nodes, and let f() be the level numbering function
of the positions of T, as given in Section 8.3.2


a Show that for every position of p pf T, f(p) <= 2^n - 2

b Show an example of a binary tree with seven nodes that attains the above upper
bound of f(p) for some position p

Solution: 

Consider a right child only tree !!
            
a See below


b Consider a right child only tree :

    Nodes        Position            Tree length(array)      Upper bound
                2*f(p) + 2              2^n - 1                2^n - 2
