Describe an algorithm , relying only on the BinaryTree operations, that counts
the number of leaves in a binary tree that are the left child of their respective
parent.

Solution: is this ok?
      
count_left(T,p)
    count = 0
    for c in T.children(p):
        count += 1 if  T.is_leaf(c)
    return count
