Answer the following questions so as to justify proposition 8.8

Solution :
    a. What is the minimum number of external nodes for a proper binary tree
        with height h ? Justify your answer.

        min = h + 1 . Keep adding a pair of nodes in one side of the tree and 
            (to keep it proper) and this property will be shown

    b. What is the maximum number of external nodes for a proper binary tree
        with heigh h ? Justify your answer

        max = 2^h . When all the leaf nodes are at the same level

    c. Let T be a proper binary tree with heigh h and n nodes. Show that

            log(n + 1) - 1 <= h <= (n -1)/2

            The inequality needs to hold for iner, minimum, maximum values of n
            If n is 3, then there is a h = 1 which gives 
                
                    1 <= 1 <= 1 
            for max values  n = 15 h = 3

                    3 <= 3  <= 7

    d. For which values of n and h can the above lower and upper bounds of h
        be attained with equality?
        
                see c for min
