When Bob wants to send Alice a message M on the Internet, he breaks M into n
data packets, numbers the packets consecutively, and injects them into the network.
When the packets arrive ar Alice's computer, they may be out of order, so Alice
must assemble the sequence of n packets in order before she can be shure she has 
the entire message. Describe an efficient scheme for Alice to do this, assuming
that she know the value of n.


In python context, imagine packets are transmitted in tupples over a network. The
first element of the tupple is an id, and the second is the packet value.

The idea is to reassemble the packets in a list using the packet id as the index.
In this way we do not care about the arrival order.

Imagine a Rx list of size n - 1 which is populated at the receiver side like this
            
            Rx[p[i][0]] = p[i][1]

where p is a list of tuples containing (id,datum)
