Describe a way to use recursion to add all the numbers in an n x n data set, 
represented as a list of lists.


    add_recursively(data, l)
        
        if (l <  0 )
           return 0

        else :
                sum = 0
                for i in range(len(data[l]))
                    sum += data[l][i]
                
                return add_recursively(data,l - 1) + sum


    it is the responsibility of the caller to give the index l and data.
